# regex
All things regular expression: implemented in python.

#### Purpose
Regular expressions are simple yet many programmers fear them. You just have to understand them and what they do to see their vast benefits in computing.
As you learn them, you will get to see how powerful they are in string manipulation, grouping, look aheads and searching in general. :-)

#### Usage
We learn by doing. Simply run the files in your prompt to see the results and experiment on different inputs.
But before this, first things first:

1. Clone the flan to your local as such:

```
    $ git clone https://github.com/andela-ggikera/regex.git
```

2. Run it on your local command line

```
   $ python <filename>.py
```
